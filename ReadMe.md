# Code Ninjas GDP Documentation

Encyclopedia for functions within the Game Development Platform. Each documented function contains a description, example(s), and further reference. This is meant to be used offline through a browser on the students' computers. This is NOT intended as a live webpage accessible on the internet. This is also a tool for Senseis to use when helping ninjas. Each location is welcome to make their own changes to the content.

This was originally made for Code Ninjas The Woodlands and has since been adapted to locations across the country. No longer work at Code Ninjas, but this repository is left up so Senseis and students can become more familiar with the Game Development Platform (as documentation was not previously available).
